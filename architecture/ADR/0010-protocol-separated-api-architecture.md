**ID**: `cpt-frontx-adr-protocol-separated-api-architecture`
## Context and Problem Statement

FrontX needed to support multiple API protocols (REST, SSE, potentially others) without coupling services to specific transports. A monolithic configuration object containing all protocol options would grow unwieldy as protocols are added and would couple the evolution of one protocol to changes in another.

## Decision Drivers

* Adding a new protocol must require no changes to existing protocol implementations (Open/Closed Principle)
* Plugin registration must be type-safe and support dynamic registration after protocol instances are created

## Considered Options

* Single configuration object with all protocol options in a flat structure
* String-based plugin identification with a shared plugin registry
* Protocol-specific configuration interfaces extending a base config; global plugin registry keyed by protocol class

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Protocol-specific configuration interfaces extending a base config; global plugin registry keyed by protocol class", because protocols evolve independently, the protocol class as Map key provides type-safe retrieval, and runtime query at request execution enables dynamic plugin discovery without constructor coupling.

### Consequences

* Good, because protocol independence, type-safe plugin management, and extensibility without modifying existing code
* Bad, because indirection is introduced (plugins are queried at request time rather than injected), and developers must understand two plugin levels — global registry and instance-level overrides

### Confirmation

Protocol-specific config interfaces (`RestProtocolConfig`, `SseProtocolConfig`) are located in `packages/api/src/protocols/`. The `apiRegistry` with Map-based plugin storage lives in `packages/api/src/registry.ts`. REST and SSE protocol implementations query the registry during request execution rather than at construction time.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Single configuration object with all protocol options in a flat structure

* Good, because simple — one object to configure all protocol behaviour
* Bad, because every new protocol adds fields to a shared object, coupling protocol evolution and producing a growing configuration surface

### String-based plugin identification with a shared plugin registry

* Good, because human-readable plugin identifiers that are easy to log and debug
* Bad, because string keys are not type-safe; mismatched strings cause silent runtime failures rather than compile-time errors

### Protocol-specific configuration interfaces extending a base config; global plugin registry keyed by protocol class

* Good, because Open/Closed Principle is satisfied — a new protocol is added by creating a new class and config interface, not by modifying existing ones
* Bad, because the two-level plugin model (global registry plus instance-level overrides) requires developers to understand the precedence rules

## More Information

Protocols query `apiRegistry` during request execution rather than receiving plugins through constructor injection. This design choice was deliberate: constructor injection would prevent dynamic plugin registration that occurs after protocol instances are created.

## Traceability

- **DESIGN**: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md)

This decision directly addresses:

* `cpt-frontx-fr-sse-protocol` — SSE protocol implementation and configuration
* `cpt-frontx-fr-sse-protocol-registry` — protocol registry and plugin discovery at request time
* `cpt-frontx-fr-sdk-api-package` — api package structure and public contracts
* `cpt-frontx-nfr-rel-api-retry` — retry plugin integration through the global registry
* `cpt-frontx-component-api` — api package component boundary
* `cpt-frontx-interface-api-service` — ApiService interface and protocol configuration contracts
