# frontx:review-pr - Review Code Changes

Ask the user for:
1. Files changed (or analyze git diff)
2. Purpose of changes

Then perform comprehensive review:

## 1. ROUTE TO TARGET FILES

Use `.ai/GUIDELINES.md` routing table to identify which target files apply.

## 2. SUMMARIZE APPLICABLE RULES

For each applicable target file, list 3-7 key rules.

## 3. ANALYZE CHANGES

Check for violations in each category:

### Event-Driven Architecture
- [ ] Actions emit events (not direct dispatch)
- [ ] Effects listen to events and update slices
- [ ] No prop drilling or callback state mutation
- [ ] Actions are pure (no getState)
- [ ] Effects update only their own slice

### Import Rules
- [ ] Same package uses relative paths
- [ ] Cross-branch uses @/ alias
- [ ] Cross-package uses @cyberfabric/* names
- [ ] No package internals imported
- [ ] No circular dependencies

### Type Rules
- [ ] No `any` types
- [ ] No `as unknown as` chains
- [ ] String IDs are constants/enums
- [ ] Type for objects, interface for React props

### Styling Rules
- [ ] No hex colors or inline styles
- [ ] Use theme tokens only
- [ ] rem-based units (px only for borders)
- [ ] Configured UI kit components only

### Registry Rules
- [ ] Self-registration used
- [ ] Registry root files unchanged
- [ ] No manual edits to registries

### API Rules
- [ ] Domain-based services (not entity-based)
- [ ] Extends BaseApiService
- [ ] Self-registers via apiRegistry
- [ ] Read endpoints use explicit descriptor contracts such as `RestEndpointProtocol.query()` / `queryWith()` only
- [ ] Write endpoints use explicit descriptor contracts such as `RestEndpointProtocol.mutation()`
- [ ] Screens use `useApiQuery(service.descriptor)` — no queryOptions or manual key factories
- [ ] Mocks in app layer

### Screenset Rules
- [ ] Uses the configured UI kit components
- [ ] Slices registered via registerSlice()
- [ ] i18n loader registered
- [ ] All text uses t()
- [ ] IDs defined as constants
